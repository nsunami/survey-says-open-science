# Survey Says: Open Science!

"Survey Says: Open Science!" is a game inspired by Family Feud, an American television game show where groups compete to name the most popular answers to survey questions to win the game.

This game is the outcome of our working group in the Open Science Retreat 2025. The retreat had about 50 participants. Thus, we wanted to have a game that allows for many players.
